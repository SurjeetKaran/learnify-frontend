# Learnify – AI Learning Platform (Frontend)

This is the frontend of **Learnify**, an AI-powered learning platform built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). It follows the new `app/` directory structure introduced in Next.js 13+ and is styled with Tailwind CSS.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the development server locally:

npm install
npm run dev
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You can start editing the homepage by modifying:
app/page.tsx
The app auto-refreshes as you edit files.
